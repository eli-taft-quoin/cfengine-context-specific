# CFEngine Context-Specific

This repository contains an overly-simplistic sample setup of CFEngine masterfiles to 
accomodate separation of policies and settings by context (hub, client, etc.).

This sample was testing against Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 18.04.
The masterfiles are from CFEngine Community 3.12.4 64-bit Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions.

For more information, see the following blog post: [TBD](https://cfengine.com/blog/)
